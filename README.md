# SolveIT-Math-Solver
What Does it Do:

SolveIT functions as a simple and interactive math solver. This software takes in any equation and can solve for its derivatives (first and the second derivative), integral, domain, range, roots, and asymptotes as well as graph the function, its derivatives, and integrals. Additionally, it keeps history for /saves the previously inputted equations of every user and allows the user to look at the graphs of those equations. Additionally, the derivative, integral, and domain functions do not use any libraries.

How to Run the Project:

All the executables are available at the calculator folder and must be executed from the same folder. You can download this folder from either the finaltp zip file or mbulusu@andrew.cmu_tp_2 zip file. To run this program, simply run the animation.py file.

Within the calculator folder, ensure that the following folders and files are within it: ‘derviative_integral.py’, ‘rootstesting.py’, ‘rangefinal.py’, ‘animation.py’, ‘asymptote.py’, ‘asymptote1.py’, ‘cmu_112_graphics.py’, ‘solveIT.png’, ‘storyboard.pdf’, and ‘proposal.pdf’, and the folders: ‘users’, ‘graphs’, and ‘pycache’.
